The i.MX 6 series are based on the ARM Cortex A9 solo, dual or quad cores (in some cases Cortex A7) and typically comes with one or more Vivante GPUs. It is designed in CMOS 40 nm process. i.MX 6 Solo, Dual and Quad were announced in January 2011, during Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 

The market for intelligent, multimedia centric, touch-based devices is increasing exponentially. Tomorrow’s battery-powered smart devices, auto infotainment and in-flight entertainment systems, medical systems, personal and enterprise class intelligent control and data systems, and new classes of devices never before seen need to present data and user interface choices to the end user primarily through rich sound, video, voice, pictures and touch, rather than keyboards and mice. The need for manufacturers to quickly provide multiple devices to fit specific market segments or niches and provide their customers with a broader range of choices is increasing just as quickly.

The i.MX6 series was designed specifically to enable this new market by bringing together high-performance scalable multimedia processing, a software-compatible family of solutions with integrated power management so that a manufacturer can deploy a full portfolio of products with a single hardware design.
Features of the i.MX6 Series Platform:

    ARM Cortex-A9-based solutions up to 1.2 GHz
    Up to HD 1080p encode and decode
    Up to 3D video playback in high definition
    Up to HD 1080p videoconferencing
